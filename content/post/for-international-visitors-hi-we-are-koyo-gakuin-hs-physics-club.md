Welcome to our home page!

We are Koyo Gakuin High School Physics Club and thank you for visiting our website.

Koyo Gakuin is a private school with unified lower and upper secondary school programs, both of whose school buildings are located in Nishinomiya, Hyogo Prefecture.  Koyo Gakuin HS Physics Club is among the four science clubs in our school, including Chemistry Club, Biology Club and Astronomy Club.

Since our main policy is "[Try and learn what you want to](https://koyophy.netlify.app/pdf/keizi.pdf)," members are encouraged to be engaged in what they are truly interested in -- from launching self-made rockets to studying special relativity -- and we believe that this environment will help every single member in our club to enhance their skills and knowledge for their future scientific career.  We also offer opportunities to present their accomplishments through "音楽と展覧の会," which is described as "Art and Exhibition" in English(so it's not like a school festival, actually).  In "音楽と展覧の会," you can visit us and learn what we are doing in everyday activities.

Currently, as you can imagine, all of our projects are suspended due to the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19.  However, we seek to hold an online session to talk about the future plan, especially what are we going to do in this year's 音楽と展覧の会.

By the way, our activities do not limit the participants.  To first graders in our high school,  junior high school students, and students in other high schools, if you are interested in what we do, don't hesitate to contact us.  We are looking forward to talking with you!
